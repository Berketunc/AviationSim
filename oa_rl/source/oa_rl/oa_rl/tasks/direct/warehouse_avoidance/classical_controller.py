"""Classical grid-based flow-field controller — the "classical" half of the
residual RL architecture (see MILESTONE2_STATUS.md's "Next steps" list,
item 1).

Mirrors oa_planning's real A*+replanning behaviour (astar.py,
planner_params.yaml: 0.2m resolution, 0.6m inflation) but precomputed once as
a static goal-directed vector field rather than searched fresh every control
cycle: since this v1 task's warehouse geometry and goal are fixed (no domain
randomization yet), a single-source Dijkstra from the goal cell over an
inflated occupancy grid gives, for every free cell, the direction of the
shortest obstacle-avoiding path to the goal — exactly what repeated
from-scratch A* replanning converges to at whatever cell the vehicle
currently occupies, just computed once instead of on every ~1s replan cycle.
`WarehouseAvoidanceEnv` adds the learned residual on top of this field's
proposed velocity (see its `_pre_physics_step`).
