# (pos_xyz, size_xyz). Unlike sim_assets/worlds/warehouse.sdf (which
# deliberately omits the west wall — safe there only because the real
# classical controller always flies +X toward the goal and never explores
# -X), the west wall is kept here: an RL policy explores in every
# direction, and spawn (-8.5, 0) sits only 1.5m from x=-10 — without a
# wall there, early/random exploration drifted out of bounds to the west
# almost immediately, confirmed live (every episode: out_of_bounds=1.0,
# mean episode length ~34 steps / ~1.4s, never reaching row A's pillars at
# x=-5). This is a deliberate, justified divergence from the Gazebo world,
# not an oversight — the two simulators serve different purposes here.

# obstacle-avoidance benefit for this task — it's a pure 2D navigation
# problem at a fixed cruise altitude. z is therefore held fixed by a small
# internal correction (see env's _apply_action), not policy-controlled;
# action_space/observation_space below only carry x/y. This also means
# "goal reached" here measures successful navigation to the goal region,
# not a landing — the actual physical landing (descent + ArUco alignment)
